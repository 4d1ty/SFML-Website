# SFML 3.0.2

## Windows

On Windows, choosing 32 or 64-bit libraries should be based on which platform you want to compile for, not which OS you have. Indeed, you can perfectly compile and run a 32-bit program on a 64-bit Windows. So you'll most likely want to target 32-bit platforms, to have the largest possible audience. Choose 64-bit packages only if you have good reasons.

!!! warning "The compiler versions have to match 100%!"

    If you want to use a MinGW package, it is *not* enough that the GCC versions seemingly match, you **have to** use one of the following matching compilers:

## Linux

On Linux, if you have a 64-bit OS then you have the 64-bit toolchain installed by default. Compiling for 32-bit is possible, but you have to install specific packages and/or use specific compiler options to do so. So downloading the 64-bit libraries is the easiest solution if you're on a 64-bit Linux.  
If you require a 32-bit build of SFML you'll have to [build it yourself](../../tutorials/3.0/getting-started/cmake.md).

!!! warning

    It's recommended to use the SFML version from your package manager (if recent enough) or build from source to prevent incompatibilities.
